# Match3
Play a game of Match3!

This is from assignment 3 of Harvard's CS50G class. The bulk of this code was created by the instructor, Colton Ogden. After turning it in, I made some more changes which I believe makes the game better.
My primary updates to the game:
* Mouse functionality
* Shiny blocks which eliminate full rows
* Reduction of colors used
